SacGTUG-Volley

### Archived

This project was meant to show examples of how to use Google's Volley HTTP library to make requests, parse different responses and load the results into a usable POJO.  The code accompanied a live talk about dealing with HTTP requests in an Android application at the time for the Sacramento GDG, which I believe has been migrated to https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-sacramento/
